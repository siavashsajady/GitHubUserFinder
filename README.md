<h1>Serach Github Users with the GitHub API </h1>
This is  a React app (class based components), deal with Github API and you can serach for all users and reach out them.

It has a detailed page for each user.

With Github API you can make a request to an end point user and it will give you a whole bunch of stuff, So I tried to make a pretty extensive profile.



I have a bunch of components in this app such as:
  user component,
  user item component,
  search component,
 and reset component.
